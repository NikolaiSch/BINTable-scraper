# BINTable scraper ( was going to make my own BIN service, and charge for it, but I didn't )

## THIS DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - Account needed now (made in 2019 when I was just starting)

- Takes around 5 minutes to scrape all (318000), not very well optimised but this was a quick script
- Scrapes all BINs from [https://binlists.com](https://binlists.com)

## 2024 notes

- Renamed some of the mts files to ts in an attempt to get it to run
